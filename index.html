<p>The original mod was created by a MinecraftForum user called Zaggy1024, however all development of the mod has discontinued on November 26, 2014 following a formal declaration stating that this mod will not be further developed.</p>

<p>Not all features and items from the original mod are going to be included. This is done to help build upon and improve the original mod, removing features will be avoided whenever possible in favour of adding them as a "creative mode only" feature.
Along with this, many new features and items will be implemented. These implementations will favour realism, so if you're looking for a mod that is primarily oriented around fun and fast-paced action, this mod is not for you.</p>

<p>Here's some of the features the reborn version of the mod will introduce:
<ul>
<li><b>New bow and arrow types</b> - each with their own advantages and disadvantages.</li>
<li><b>Support archery items</b> - examples: quiver, shooting gloves, thumb rings, finger pads...</li>
<li><b>Custom bow and arrow textures</b> - a true bowyer knows that looks are as important as speed.</li>
<li><b>Unique bow customization</b> - improve both aesthetics and functionality of your bows.</li>
<li><b>Realistic archery mechanics</b> - like difference in arrow accuracy and speed.</li>
<li><b>Plenty of humour</b> - that's one thing this mod will not lack, I promise.</li>
</ul> 

<p><i>Keep in mind that most game mechanics will be modular, which means you will be able to turn them on and off in the configuration file. This gives you the freedom of mod customization.</i></p>

<p>If you're running an older version of Minecraft I suggest taking a look at a 1.7.10 version of this project created and maintained by Jackiecrazy.
