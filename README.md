# Better Archery Reborn
This project is an attempt at bringing an old Minecraft 1.6.4 mod called Better Archery back to life for Minecraft 1.10. 

The original mod was created by a MinecraftForum user called Zaggy1024, however all development of the mod has discontinued on November 26, 2014 following a formal declaration stating that this mod will not be further developed.

Not all features and items from the original mod are going to be included. This is done to help build upon and improve the original mod, removing features will be avoided whenever possible in favour of adding them as a "creative mode only" feature.
Along with this, many new features and items will be implemented. These implementations will favour realism, so if you're looking for a mod that is primarily oriented around fun and fast-paced action, this mod is not for you.

Most features will be modular, which means you will be able to turn them on and off in the configuration file.

If you're running an older version of Minecraft I suggest taking a look at a [1.7.10 version](https://github.com/Jackiecrazy/Arms-of-the-Bowyer) of this project created and maintained by Jackiecrazy.
