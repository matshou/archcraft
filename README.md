# Better-Archery-Reborn
This project is an attempt at bringing an old Minecraft 1.6.4 mod called Better Archery back to life. The original mod was created by a MinecraftForum user called Zaggy1024. All development of the mod has discontinued on November 26, 2014 with a public declaration on MinecraftForum.
