# Better Archery Reborn
This project is an attempt at bringing an old Minecraft 1.6.4 mod called Better Archery back to life. The original mod was created by a MinecraftForum user called Zaggy1024. All development of the mod has discontinued on November 26, 2014. The public declaration made by the mod owner about the mod is available  [here](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1289058-better-archery-v1-6-2-adds-new-bows-arrows-quivers).
